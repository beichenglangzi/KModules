# Skeletal Animation
### Design
This is one of the most complex but helpful modules I have developed. Before I created this module, I used the **SCNAnimationPlayer**, which works, but it is hard to control (you will see what I mean), and the transitions do not look very nice. Therefore, I decided to design my own modules. The basic idea is to have two classes named **Model** and **Animation**. The **Model** class inherits **SCNNode** and is responsible for loading a rigged model and controlling all the **Animation** objects attached to it. It is always a good idea to isolate the animations. For example, when making characters, I always add the **Model** node as a child node to a control node. The **Model** node only handles animations, while the control node handles movements, physics, and other logic. There is nothing special about the **Animation** class: it loads a single animation and updates every frame, controlled by a **Model** object. Note that these modules require you to be familiar with modeling software like Maya because first, you have to make sure that the skeleton of the rigged model is the same as that of the animations. Otherwise, it will not work. Second, the **Animation** class cannot trim the animations, so you have to edit that by yourself.
